**Java has the following conditional statements:**

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

# The if Statement
Use the if statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is true.
# Syntax
if (condition) 
 
 {
  
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
  
}
